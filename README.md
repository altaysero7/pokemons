# pokemons

Program that mimics the world of Pok√©mons

The program enables users to create Lutemons, which are then stored home.
User has then an option to move those Lutemons to a training area or to a battle field.

When a Lutemon is trained it gains experience, which affects other features.
If experience is 2 then in fighting attack will get that +2 points.

Battle is turn based where one Lutemon attacks to another, which then uses its defenses and then attacks back.
When one of them has health 0 or less the other one wins and gains an experience point.
The other one dies and gets removed from the program. The winner gains one point of experience.
